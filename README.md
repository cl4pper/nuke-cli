> A CLI focused on powering the start of your web project.

Have a look at the original [boilerplate](https://github.com/cl4pper/react-setup).

In this version you'll be able to create a React project from zero
- React powered by [TypeScript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript)
- [webpack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack) as the module bundler
- unit tests run by [Jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest) and [React Testing Library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@testing-library/react)

Coming up...
- local code lintintg by [Prettier](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier)
- CI by Github actions
- Docker settings
- **create a Node based API** from zero
